 *
 * With @a worst_case zero the frame is serialized, its CRC-15 computed and the
 * stuff bits counted exactly. With @a worst_case non-zero the maximum legal
 * stuff count is assumed instead, which is cheaper but overstates a typical
 * extended frame by around a fifth.
 *
 * CAN FD frames return a documented approximation, because FD uses different
 * stuff rules and a wider CRC.
